=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a graphics plotting front-end for PDL.  It is intended to
implement minimal plotting functionality by dispatching plot calls to
a relevant, working plot library.

=head1 NAME

PDL::Graphics::Simple - Simple backend-independent plotting for PDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
 TBD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDL can plot through a plethora of external plotting modules.  Each
module tends to be less widely available than Perl itself, and to
require an additional step or two to install.  For simple applications 
("throw up an image on the screen", or "plot a curve") it is useful to 
have a subset of all plotting capability available in a backend-independent
layer.  PDL::Graphics::Simple provides that capability.

PDL::Graphics::Simple defines an object that represents a plotting
window/interface.  When you construct the object, you can either specify a 
backend or allow PDL::Graphics::Simple to find a backend that seems to work 
on your system.  Subsequent plotting commands are translated and passed
through to your chosen plotting module.

Only a small subset of PDL's graphics functionality is supported --
PDL::Graphics::Simple is intended for quick monkeying around with data 
or for demos or other applications where platform independence is more
important than configurability, plot quality, or speed.

Only 2-D plotting is supported.  For 3-D plotting, use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot
or PDL::Graphics::Trid directly.
