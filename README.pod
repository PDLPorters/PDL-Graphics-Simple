=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a graphics plotting front-end for PDL.  It is intended to
implement minimal plotting functionality by dispatching plot calls to
a relevant, working plot library.

=head1 NAME

PDL::Graphics::Simple - Simple backend-independent plotting for PDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
 TBD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDL can plot through a plethora of external plotting modules.  Each
module tends to be less widely available than Perl itself, and to
require an additional step or two to install.  For simple applications 
("throw up an image on the screen", or "plot a curve") it is useful to 
have a subset of all plotting capability available in a backend-independent
layer.  PDL::Graphics::Simple provides that capability.

PDL::Graphics::Simple defines an object that represents a plotting
window/interface.  When you construct the object, you can either specify a 
backend or allow PDL::Graphics::Simple to find a backend that seems to work 
on your system.  Subsequent plotting commands are translated and passed
through to your chosen plotting module.

Only a small subset of PDL's graphics functionality is supported --
PDL::Graphics::Simple is intended for quick monkeying around with data 
or for demos or other applications where platform independence is more
important than configurability, plot quality, or speed.

Only 2-D plotting is supported.  For 3-D plotting, use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot
or PDL::Graphics::Trid directly.

=head1 SUPPORTED BACKENDS

PDL::Graphics::Simple supports:

=over 3

=item Gnuplot (via PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot)

=item PGPLOT  (via PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window)

=item PLplot (via PDL::Graphics::PLplot)

=item Prima (via PDL::Graphics::Prima).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

(More to come RSN)

=cut
=head2 show

=for usage

 PDL::Graphics::Simple::show

=for ref

C<list> lists the supported engines.

=cut
=head2 new 

=for usage

 $w = new PDL::Graphics::Simple( %opts );

=for ref

c<new> is the main constructor for PDL::Graphics::Simple.  It accepts a list of options
about the type of window you want:

=over 3

=item engine

If specified, this must be one of the supported plotting engines.  You can use a module
name or the shortened name.  If you don't give one, the constructor will scan through existing
modules and pick one that seems to work.

=item size

This is a window size as an ARRAY ref containing [width, height,
units].  If no units are specified, the default should be "pixels",
using the standard conversions of 72 points per inch, 100 pixels per
inch.

=item type

This describes the kind of plot to create. The default is
"interactive" if neither type nor output are specified, and should
result in a plot being displayed (e.g. via X11 or the engine's default
display method). If the output is specified and appears to be a qualified
graphics filename (i.e. has a dot-extension with 2-4 characters at the end)
the default is 'f'.

Accepted values are "interactive" and "file", which can be abbreviated
to 'i' and 'f'.

=item output

This should be a window number for interactive plots, or a file name
for file plots.  The default file name is "plot.png" in the current
working directory.  Individual plotting modules are meant to support
at least '.png', '.pdf', and '.ps', if necessary via format conversion.
Most other standard file types are supported but are not guaranteed to work.

=back

=cut
=head2 plot

=for usage

 $w = new PDL::Graphics::Simple ( %opts );
 $w->plot($data);

=for ref

=head1 Internals

PDL::Graphics::Simple defines several subclasses that implement the
individual interfaces.  The subclasses are very simple and inherit
only a collection of stubroutines that die with a "not implemented"
message. 

=head2 Interface subclass methods

Each interface module supports the following methods:

=cut
=head3 check 

C<check> attempts to load the relevant engine module and test that it
is working.  It registers its success or failure in the main $mods
hash, under the "ok" flag.  If there is a failure that generates an
error message, the error is logged under the "msg" flag.

C<check> accepts one parameter, "force".  If it is missing or false,
and "ok" is defined, check just echoes the prior result.  If it is
true, then check actually checks the status regardless of the "ok"
flag.

=head3 new

C<new> creates and returns an appropriate plot object, or dies on
failure.

Each c<new> method should accept the following options, defined by the
PDL::Graphics::Simple::new method (above).

=over 3

=item size

=item type

=item output

=back

=head3 plot

C<plot> generates a plot.  It should accept a standardized collection of
options as generated by the PDL::Graphics::Simple plot method: standard
plot options as a hash ref, followed by a list of curve blocks.  Each
curve block consists of an ARRAY ref with a hash in the 0 element and
all required data in the following elements, one PDL per (ordinate/abscissa).
For 1-D plot types (like points and lines) the PDLs must be 1D.  For image
plot types the lone PDL must be 2D (monochrome) or 3D(RGB).

Details TBD.

Notes:

=over 3

=item replot/oplot

One of the plot options should cause overplotting rather than direct clear plotting.

=item plot types

Standard plot types (lines, points, tbd) are generated as individual curves;
the "lines" convenience routine in the parent module just invokes plot.

=item argument parsing

irregularities in arguments are parsed by the parent module.
